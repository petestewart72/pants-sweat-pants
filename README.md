# Sweaty's Sweatpants Shop

## Description:
The objective of the group project was to create a fictitious e-commerce site for a company that sells sweatpants. This was built as a group project assignment during my enrollment at [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/) while we were learning to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. 

## Features:
